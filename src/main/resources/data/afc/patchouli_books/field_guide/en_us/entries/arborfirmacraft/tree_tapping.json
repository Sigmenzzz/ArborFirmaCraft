If the conditions are right, your barrel will immediately begin to fill with sap."

		"text": "Not all trees produce useful sap all of the time. Maple and Birch trees produce sap only from February to May, and only when the temperature is within 3°C of freezing. Hevea trees produce latex only when the temperature is above 22°C. Rubber Figs produce latex at 12°C or above, but produce more slowly than Hevea. Consider latitude, altitude, and local variation whenever tapping a tree."
