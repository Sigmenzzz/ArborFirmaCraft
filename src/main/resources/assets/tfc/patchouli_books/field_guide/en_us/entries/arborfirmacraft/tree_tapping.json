If the conditions are right, your barrel will immediately begin to fill with sap."

Hevea trees produce latex only when the temperature is above 22째C. Rubber Figs produce latex at 12째C or above, but produce more slowly than Hevea. Latitude, altitude, time of the year, and the time of day all impact the temperature, and thus the flow of sap."
